### Why use these utilities?

If you are asking you why to download that utilities/small programs, you need to know that they can be really useful if you work with batch files, or you need some automated tasks.
They are virus-free, and for all of them you can see the source, so you ensure that's a clean file.

### List of small utilities that I have made:

* Base64: To encode/decode files in Base64. Useful if you want to send files, ensuring that they have been not modified or at least making harder his modification
* BFP (Batch File Packer): As the name indicates, it is for packing (compressing) batch files
* EchoMath: With that utility you can do mathematical operations from CMD directly from `echo` command by piping it.
* HexRGBConvert: Convert RGB colors to hexadecimal and vice versa.
* MsgBox: To display customized message boxes, with custom buttons, icons and actions when some action happens
* PlaySound: To play sounds within any window and fast




### What compiler/packer do you use?

For batch plugins, I actually use Bat To Exe eVolved. I like it because it is open-source and they cannot be any malware at the code, as we have checked the C code. The other compiler/packer I used before that was Bat to exe Converter by Fatik Kodak (F2KO). I have remove all copies of programs using that because we have found possible malware (rootkits) at the compiled/packed files

For C plugins, I use Tiny C Compiler, by Fabrice Bellard

Why I like it? The answer is really simple: It creates really small executables for small programs (over ~2 kB) and the compiler itself it's also really small.

### These programs are safe?

Yes, all this programs are completely safe as they are published with their source code. To compile you the programs, check up what I use and what to use.
